# Wine-Quality-Prediction
The task here is to predict the quality of red wine on a scale of 0â€“10 given a set of features as inputs. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression. The dataset used is Wine Quality Data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
